# Linux Post-Installation Script - AI Context

> ðŸ¤– This overview helps AI assistants understand the Linux Post-Installation Script project

## Project Summary

This project is a comprehensive post-installation script collection for Linux distributions, specifically designed to automate the setup and configuration of fresh Linux installations. It streamlines the process of installing essential software, configuring system settings, and applying customizations across different Linux distributions.

## Project Context

### What is this project?
A collection of bash scripts that automate post-installation tasks on Linux systems, including:
- Software installation (via APT, Flatpak, Snap)
- System configurations
- Development environment setup
- Productivity tools installation
- Customization scripts for different Linux distributions

### Target Users
- Linux users who frequently reinstall or setup new systems
- Developers needing consistent development environments
- System administrators managing multiple Linux machines
- Linux enthusiasts who want to automate their setup process

### Supported Distributions
- Ubuntu (18.04, 20.04, 22.04+)
- Pop!_OS (20.04, 22.04+)
- Linux Mint (19, 19.3, 20+)
- Other Debian-based distributions (with minor adjustments)

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: Bash scripting
- **Package Managers**: APT, Flatpak, Snap
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Automation**: Shell scripts with modular design

## Navigation Guide

For AI assistants working on this project:
1. Start with `linux/post_install.sh` for the main script logic
2. Check `linux/auto/` for modular installation components
3. Review `linux/distros/` for distribution-specific variations
4. Consult `.ai/conventions/` for coding standards
5. See `.ai/patterns/` for common implementation patterns
6. Reference `.ai/context/` for detailed technical context

## Development Philosophy

This project follows the principle of:
- **Modularity**: Scripts are broken into logical components
- **Flexibility**: Easy to customize for personal needs
- **Reliability**: Extensive error checking and user feedback
- **Community**: Open to contributions and improvements
- **Simplicity**: Clear, readable bash scripts

## Getting Started

To use these scripts:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BragatteMAS/Linux_posintall_script
cd os-postinstall-scripts/linux
chmod +x post_install.sh
sudo ./post_install.sh
```
