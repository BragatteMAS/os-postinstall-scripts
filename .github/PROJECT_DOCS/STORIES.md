## üìù Notes for CLAUDE.md Application

Based on the answers above, when working on this project:

1. **Always include shell script best practices** - ShellCheck compliance, error handling
2. **Skip frontend frameworks** - No React, Vue, or web UI code needed
3. **Focus on CLI/TUI patterns** - Command line interfaces, not graphical
4. **Emphasize cross-platform compatibility** - Test on Linux, macOS, Windows
5. **Include Testing Trophy approach** - But adapted for shell scripts
6. **Documentation is critical** - Clear examples, guides, and inline comments
7. **Security first** - Never expose credentials, always validate input
8. **Performance matters** - Scripts should be fast and efficient

This modular approach ensures CLAUDE.md provides relevant guidance without overwhelming with irrelevant patterns.
