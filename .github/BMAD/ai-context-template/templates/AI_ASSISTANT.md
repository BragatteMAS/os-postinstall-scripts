## Working with This Codebase

### Key Principles
1. **Follow existing patterns** - Maintain consistency with current code style
2. **Preserve functionality** - Don't break existing features when making changes
3. **Document changes** - Update comments and docs when modifying code
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure changes don't introduce regressions

### Code Style Guidelines
<!-- Add your specific guidelines here -->
- Indentation: [spaces/tabs]
