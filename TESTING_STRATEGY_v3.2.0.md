# 🎯 Testing Strategy v3.2.0 - OS Post-Install Scripts

> **Version:** 3.2.0 | **Created:** 2025-07-27 | **QA Agent:** Lisa  
> **Philosophy:** "Trust but verify - when YOU choose"  
> **Approach:** 100% Manual, On-Demand Testing

## 📌 Critical Testing Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **NO Automated Test Execution**
   - All tests are manual and on-demand
   - User maintains complete control
   - No CI/CD test automation
   - No hooks into installation process
   - Tests run only when explicitly requested

2. **User-Controlled Verification**
   - Clear instructions for each test
   - Expected outcomes documented
   - Platform-specific variations noted
   - Time estimates provided
   - Recovery procedures included

3. **Educational Approach**
   - Tests teach system behavior
   - Verbose output for learning
   - Explanations of what's being tested
   - Why each test matters

## 📋 Test Plans for v3.2.0 Stories

### Story 1.1: Quick Start Installation

#### Test: Minimal Base Installation (15 minutes)
```bash
# Location: tests/manual/smoke/minimal-base.sh
# Purpose: Verify minimal base installs in under 15 minutes
# When to run: After implementing quick start

# Test Steps:
1. Start timer
2. Run: ./setup.sh --minimal
3. Verify installed: zsh, oh-my-zsh, bat, eza, fd, ripgrep, git
4. Check timer < 15 minutes
5. Verify no errors in logs

# Expected Output:
✅ All minimal tools installed
✅ Installation time: 12-14 minutes
✅ No error messages
✅ Tools executable from PATH

# Platform Variations:
- Linux: apt-based installation
- macOS: homebrew-based installation
- Windows: Not applicable for v3.2.0
```

#### Test: Progress Indicators
```bash
# Location: tests/manual/integration/installer/progress-test.sh
# Purpose: Verify progress indicators show time remaining
# When to run: After UI implementation

# Test Steps:
1. Run installer with --verbose
2. Observe progress bars
3. Verify time estimates
4. Check accuracy of estimates

# Expected Behavior:
✅ Progress bar shows percentage
✅ Time remaining updates every 30 seconds
✅ Estimates within ±2 minutes of actual
✅ Clear status messages
```

### Story 1.6: PRD/STORIES Technology Detection

#### Test: Document Parser Accuracy
```bash
# Location: tests/manual/integration/parser/accuracy-test.sh
# Purpose: Verify technology detection from documents
# When to run: After parser implementation

# Test Data: tests/fixtures/sample-prds/
- python-django-project.md
- react-typescript-app.md
- rust-cli-tool.md
- mixed-stack-project.md

# Test Steps:
1. Run: ./tools/parse-context.sh tests/fixtures/sample-prds/python-django-project.md
2. Verify detected: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis
3. Check confidence scores > 0.8
4. Verify no false positives

# Expected Output:
{
  "detected_technologies": {
    "languages": ["Python"],
    "frameworks": ["Django"],
    "databases": ["PostgreSQL", "Redis"],
    "tools": ["Docker", "pytest"]
  },
  "confidence_scores": {
    "Python": 0.95,
    "Django": 0.92,
    "PostgreSQL": 0.88
  }
}
```

#### Test: Fuzzy Matching
```bash
# Location: tests/manual/integration/parser/fuzzy-match-test.sh
# Purpose: Verify variations are detected
# When to run: After fuzzy logic implementation

# Test Cases:
- "node.js" → Node.js
- "postgres" → PostgreSQL
- "react native" → React Native
- "express.js" → Express

# Verification:
✅ Common variations detected
✅ Case insensitive matching
✅ Partial matches with context
✅ No overly aggressive matching
```

### Story 1.7: Manual Test Execution

#### Test: Test Documentation Clarity
```bash
# Location: tests/manual/acceptance/test-docs-test.sh
# Purpose: Verify test instructions are clear
# When to run: After documentation update

# Test Steps:
1. Give TESTING.md to new user
2. Ask them to run smoke tests
3. Time how long to understand
4. Note any confusion points

# Success Criteria:
✅ User runs tests within 5 minutes
✅ No critical steps missed
✅ Clear when to run each test
✅ Troubleshooting helps resolve issues
```

### Story 4.2: Deprecate Profile System

#### Test: Deprecation Warnings
```bash
# Location: tests/manual/integration/installer/deprecation-test.sh
# Purpose: Verify profile deprecation messages
# When to run: After deprecation implementation

# Test Steps:
1. Run: ./setup.sh --profile developer
2. Verify deprecation warning appears
3. Check migration guide link works
4. Verify old behavior still functions
5. Test recommendation mapping

# Expected Output:
⚠️  WARNING: Profile system is deprecated in v3.2.0
⚠️  Profiles will be removed in v4.0.0
📚 Migration Guide: https://github.com/.../MIGRATION.md
💡 Recommended alternative: ./setup.sh --context your-prd.md

```

## 🎓 Educational Testing

### Learning Through Testing

Each test includes educational output:

```bash
# Example output from minimal-base.sh:
🎓 EDUCATION MODE ENABLED

📚 What this test verifies:
- Minimal base includes only essential tools
- Installation completes in under 15 minutes
- All tools are accessible from PATH
- No errors during installation

🔍 Why this matters:
- Quick setup improves developer experience
- Essential tools enable immediate productivity
- Error-free installation builds confidence
- PATH configuration prevents "command not found"

💡 What you're learning:
- How package managers work
- Why certain tools are "essential"
- How PATH affects command availability
- What makes an installation "successful"
```

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run all smoke tests (5 min)
make test-smoke

# Run specific story tests
make test-story-1.1
make test-story-1.6

# Run security tests only

## 📝 Test Development Guidelines

### Writing New Tests

1. **User-Focused**
   - Test what users care about
   - Avoid implementation details
   - Focus on outcomes

2. **Clear Documentation**
   - Purpose statement
   - When to run
   - Expected outcomes
   - Time estimates

3. **Platform Awareness**
   - Note platform differences
   - Provide alternatives
   - Document limitations

4. **Educational Value**
   - Explain what's tested
   - Show why it matters
   - Teach through output

> **Remember:** These tests are tools for confidence, not obstacles to development.  
> **Philosophy:** Run tests when YOU need confidence, not because a system demands it.  
> **Goal:** Make testing so easy and valuable that developers WANT to run tests.
