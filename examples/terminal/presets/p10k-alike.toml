# p10k-alike Starship Preset
# Approximates Powerlevel10k Lean style — two-line prompt
#
# Includes username, hostname (SSH only), directory, git info, cmd_duration.
# Explicit git_status symbols match p10k defaults.
# vi-mode indicator via vimcmd_symbol.
#
# NOTE: This approximates p10k Lean style. Starship cannot replicate
# p10k's instant prompt or transient prompt features.
#
# Usage: cp p10k-alike.toml ~/.config/starship.toml
"$schema" = "https://starship.rs/config-schema.json"
