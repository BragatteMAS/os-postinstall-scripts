> **Note:** This sprint plan follows BMAD Method principles while maintaining flexibility for the single-developer reality. All dates are targets, not commitments. Manual testing philosophy is maintained throughout.

> **Remember:** "Simplification Over Features" - Every decision should make the system easier to use, not more complex.
