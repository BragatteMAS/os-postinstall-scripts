# OS Post-Install Scripts - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Version:** 2.0.0 | **Date:** 2025-01-27 | **Type:** Brownfield Evolution  
> **Current System Version:** v3.1.0 | **Target Version:** v3.2.0+

## Executive Summary

OS Post-Install Scripts has evolved from a personal bash script collection (2024) through an intensive July 2025 development sprint into a sophisticated, AI-enhanced development environment automation system. This PRD captures both the original vision and the system's evolution, including current state analysis, technical debt, and strategic path forward.

### Key Evolution Themes
- **Simplification Over Features**: Replace 5-profile system with minimal base + intelligent recommendations
- **Functional Equivalence Over Platform Parity**: Platform-optimized experiences (Mac/Linux 45% each, Windows 10%)
- **AI as Assistant, Not Automator**: BMAD agents suggest and teach, don't autonomously decide
- **Manual Testing Philosophy**: ALL tests on-demand only, never automated

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Automate** the setup of development environments across Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms
- **Standardize** configurations to ensure consistency across different machines and teams
- **Reduce** setup time from hours/days to minutes through intelligent automation
- **Enable** both developers and IT professionals to quickly provision new systems
- **Provide** a modular, extensible framework that adapts to different use cases
- **Ensure** security best practices are followed during system configuration
- **Support** multiple Linux distributions and desktop environments
- **Simplify** user experience through intelligent recommendations vs rigid profiles

### Background Context

Setting up a new development machine is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Developers often spend hours or even days installing tools, configuring environments, and tweaking settings. This process is typically manual, inconsistent, and difficult to replicate across teams or when switching machines.

The OS Post-Install Scripts project addresses this pain point by providing a comprehensive, automated solution that transforms a fresh OS installation into a fully configured development powerhouse. By leveraging shell scripting best practices and a modular architecture, the project enables users to quickly set up consistent, secure, and optimized development environments.

### Evolution Journey

The project underwent rapid evolution during July 2025:
- **v1.0 (2024)**: Personal bash script collection
- **v2.0.0 (Dec 2024)**: Modular architecture introduction
- **v2.3.0 (Early July 2025)**: Documentation revolution with CLAUDE.md
- **v2.3.1 (Mid July 2025)**: Critical security fix (APT lock vulnerability)
- **v2.4.0 (Mid July 2025)**: Profile system (later identified as over-engineered)
- **v2.5.0 (Late July 2025)**: AI enhancement with BMAD agents
- **v3.0.0 (Late July 2025)**: Complete repository restructuring
- **v3.1.0 (Late July 2025)**: Template system and BMAD v4.32.0

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working Well

1. **Rapid Automated Setup** - 25-minute transformation from fresh OS to configured development environment
2. **Modern CLI Revolution** - Next-gen tools (bat, eza, fd, ripgrep, zoxide) transform terminal experience
3. **AI Integration** - BMAD Method v4.32.0 with pre-configured agents (context7, fetch, sequential-thinking, serena)
4. **Modular Architecture** - Clear separation of concerns with organized directory structure
5. **Security Response** - Rapid patching of critical vulnerabilities (v2.3.1 APT lock fix)

### Current Pain Points

1. **Over-Engineered Profile Complexity**
   - 5-profile system forces users into predefined boxes
   - Users want minimal base + intelligent guidance, not categorization
   - Creates unnecessary cognitive overhead

2. **Poor Cross-Platform Support**
   - Linux: 100% (excellent, especially Ubuntu-based)
   - macOS: 20% (basic functionality only)
   - Windows: ~0% (virtually non-existent)
   - Daily friction for multi-OS developers

3. **Minimal Test Coverage (5%)**
   - Modifications feel dangerous without safety net
   - Customization requires blind faith
   - Integration issues discovered in production

### Technical Debt

1. **Architectural Debt**
   - Monolithic bash structure with platform-specific duplication
   - Three separate scripts for each tool installation
