# OS Post-Install Scripts - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Automate** the setup of development environments across Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms
- **Standardize** configurations to ensure consistency across different machines and teams
- **Reduce** setup time from hours/days to minutes through intelligent automation
- **Enable** both developers and IT professionals to quickly provision new systems
- **Provide** a modular, extensible framework that adapts to different use cases
- **Ensure** security best practices are followed during system configuration
- **Support** multiple Linux distributions and desktop environments

### Background Context

Setting up a new development machine is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Developers often spend hours or even days installing tools, configuring environments, and tweaking settings. This process is typically manual, inconsistent, and difficult to replicate across teams or when switching machines.

The OS Post-Install Scripts project addresses this pain point by providing a comprehensive, automated solution that transforms a fresh OS installation into a fully configured development powerhouse. By leveraging shell scripting best practices and a modular architecture, the project enables users to quickly set up consistent, secure, and optimized development environments.
