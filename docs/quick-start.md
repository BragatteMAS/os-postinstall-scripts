cd os-postinstall-scripts

# Run profile-based setup
./setup-with-profile.sh
```

Available profiles:

- `fd` (better find)
- `ripgrep` (better grep)
- `zoxide` (better cd)
- And more!

### "I need a full dev environment ASAP"
```bash
./setup-with-profile.sh --profile developer-minimal
```

### "I'm setting up multiple machines"
```bash
# Use the same profile on all machines
./setup-with-profile.sh --profile developer-standard --dry-run  # Preview first
./setup-with-profile.sh --profile developer-standard            # Then install
```

### "I'm a student learning to code"
```bash
./setup-with-profile.sh --profile student
```

## ⚡ What Happens During Installation?

1. **System Detection** - We identify your OS and architecture
2. **Package Updates** - System packages are updated (safely!)
3. **Tool Installation** - Selected tools are installed
4. **Configuration** - Shell and tool configs are applied
5. **Verification** - Installation is tested

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **No forced operations** - We wait for package managers, never force
- **Backup creation** - Your existing configs are backed up
- **Idempotent** - Safe to run multiple times
- **Validation** - All inputs are sanitized
- **Dry run mode** - Preview changes before applying

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Installation seems stuck"
The script might be waiting for a package manager lock. This is normal - we wait safely instead of forcing.

### "Permission denied"
Make sure to run with proper permissions:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### "Command not found after installation"
Reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### "I want to undo changes"
Check for backup files:
```bash
ls ~/.*.bak  # Your original configs
```

## 📖 Next Steps

- 📚 Read the full [User Guide](user-guide.md)
- 🎨 Customize your [Shell Configuration](shell-customization.md)
- 🛠️ Learn about [Modern CLI Tools](modern-cli-tools.md)
- 🤝 [Contribute](../CONTRIBUTING.md) to the project

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start minimal** - You can always add more tools later
2. **Use profiles** - They're tested configurations that work well together
3. **Read the output** - The script explains what it's doing
4. **Check versions** - Run with `--help` to see all options
