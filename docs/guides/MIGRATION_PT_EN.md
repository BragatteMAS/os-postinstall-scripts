# Migration Guide: Portuguese to English (v2.7.0)

This document describes the internationalization changes from Portuguese to English in version 2.7.0 of the os-postinstall-scripts project.

## Overview

Version 2.7.0 introduces complete English translation for:
- All user-facing messages
- All code comments
- All documentation
- All function and variable names (already in English)

## What Changed

### 1. User Messages (Phase 2)
All output messages shown to users have been translated:

| Script | Portuguese Example | English Translation |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| setup.sh | "Sistema Detectado" | "Detected System" |
| setup.sh | "Instalando ferramentas do sistema" | "Installing system tools" |
| setup.sh | "Verificando ferramentas instaladas" | "Checking installed tools" |
| install_rust_tools.sh | "Configuração completa!" | "Configuration complete!" |

### 2. Code Comments (Phase 3)
All comments in source code are now in English:

| File | Portuguese | English |
|------|------------|---------|
| setup.sh | `# Cores` | `# Colors` |
| setup.sh | `# Detectar sistema` | `# Detect system` |
| zshrc | `## Função para criar ambiente` | `## Function to create environment` |
| zshrc | `# Verificar ferramentas` | `# Check tools` |

### 3. Documentation (Phase 1 & 2.3)
- `docs/ai-tools-setup.md` - Fully translated to English
- All inline documentation in scripts translated

### 4. Function Names (Phase 4)
No changes needed - all functions were already using English names:
- `detect_system()`
- `install_rust_tools()`
- `check_dependencies()`
- etc.

## Compatibility

### For Users
The scripts maintain full functionality. The only visible change is that all messages are now in English.

### For Developers
- All new contributions should use English for:
  - Variable names
  - Function names
  - Comments
  - Documentation
  - Commit messages

- `v2.7.2` - Phase 2 complete: All user messages
- `v2.7.3` - Phase 3 complete: All code comments
