# Installation Profiles

This directory previously contained YAML profile definitions. The profile system now uses plain text files in `data/packages/profiles/`.

See [Installation Profiles Guide](../../docs/installation-profiles.md) for details.

## Quick Reference

```bash
./setup.sh minimal    # Essential packages only
./setup.sh developer  # Development environment (default)
./setup.sh full       # Everything
```
