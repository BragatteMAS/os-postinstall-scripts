# Gap Remediation Plan - PRD vs STORIES Alignment

> **Date:** 2025-01-27 | **Owner:** PO (Sarah) | **Priority:** Critical

## üéØ Executive Summary

Following validation of PRD v2.0.0 against STORIES.md, critical gaps have been identified that must be remediated before v3.2.0 development begins. This plan provides a structured approach to align all user stories with the new strategic direction.

## üîç Identified Gaps & Remediation Actions

### Gap 1: Profile System Misalignment

**Current State**: STORIES.md describes 5 preset profiles
**Target State**: Intelligent recommendations based on PRD/STORIES parsing
**Impact**: High - Core v3.2.0 feature

**Remediation Actions**:
1. Delete Story 1.2 preset profile references
2. Create new Story 1.2: "Intelligent Tool Recommendations"
3. Add Story 1.5: "PRD/STORIES Technology Detection"
4. Update acceptance criteria to reflect recommendation engine

### Gap 2: Testing Philosophy Conflict

**Current State**: Stories imply automated CI/CD test execution
**Target State**: ALL tests manual, on-demand only
**Impact**: Critical - Safety and philosophy

**Remediation Actions**:
1. Update Story 0.3 to emphasize manual execution
2. Add explicit "no automation" criteria
3. Create test execution guide story
4. Update all test-related acceptance criteria

### Gap 3: Performance Expectations

**Current State**: 30-minute installation time
**Target State**: 15-minute minimal base, 30-minute full
**Impact**: Medium - User expectations

**Remediation Actions**:
1. Split installation time criteria
2. Add "minimal base" vs "full setup" stories
3. Define what constitutes "minimal base"
4. Update progress indicators accordingly

### Gap 4: Missing Intelligent Features

**Current State**: No stories for intelligent parsing
**Target State**: PRD/STORIES-driven recommendations
**Impact**: High - Key differentiator

**New Stories Required**:
1. "Project Context Analysis" 
2. "Technology Stack Detection"
3. "Recommendation Engine"
4. "User Guidance System"

### Gap 5: Platform Strategy Absence

**Current State**: Generic cross-platform mentions
**Target State**: Mac/Linux 45% each, Windows 10%
**Impact**: Medium - Development focus

**Remediation Actions**:
1. Add platform-specific epic
2. Create Mac parity stories
3. Define Windows limitations clearly
4. Update cross-platform stories

## üìÖ Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Critical Updates (Immediate)
- [ ] Update testing philosophy in all stories
- [ ] Remove automated test references
- [ ] Fix profile system stories

### Phase 2: New Story Creation (Day 2)
- [ ] Draft intelligent recommendation stories
- [ ] Create platform-specific stories
- [ ] Add minimal base installation story

### Phase 3: Validation (Day 3)
- [ ] Cross-reference all stories with PRD
- [ ] Ensure acceptance criteria alignment
- [ ] Update story priorities

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

1. Zero conflicts between PRD promises and STORIES
2. All v3.2.0 features have corresponding stories
3. Clear platform priorities reflected
4. Manual testing philosophy consistent throughout
5. Performance expectations aligned

## üö® Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: Adding too many new stories
   - *Mitigation*: Focus only on PRD commitments

2. **User Confusion**: Changing established patterns
   - *Mitigation*: Clear migration documentation

3. **Development Delay**: Extensive story updates
   - *Mitigation*: Prioritize critical gaps first
