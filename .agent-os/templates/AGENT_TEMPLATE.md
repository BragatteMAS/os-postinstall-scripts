# [Agent Name] Agent

## üéØ Role

[Detailed description of the agent's role, responsibilities, and expertise area. Be specific about what this agent is designed to do and when it should be invoked.]

## üîç Problem-Solving Approach

This agent follows the structured **PROBLEMA ‚Üí AN√ÅLISE ‚Üí SOLU√á√ÉO ‚Üí ENTREGA** methodology:

### 1. PROBLEMA (Problem Identification)
- **Objective**: [What problem does this agent solve?]
- **Input Recognition**: [What types of requests trigger this agent?]
- **Scope Definition**: [What is within and outside this agent's scope?]
- **Success Criteria**: [How do we know the problem is solved?]

### 2. AN√ÅLISE (Analysis Phase)
- **Information Gathering**:
  1. [Specific data collection step]
  2. [Pattern recognition approach]
  3. [Context understanding method]
  
- **Tools Usage**:
  ```
  Tool: [tool-name]
  Purpose: [why this tool is used]
  Expected Output: [what we get from this tool]
  ```

- **Validation Steps**:
  - [ ] [Validation checkpoint 1]
  - [ ] [Validation checkpoint 2]
  - [ ] [Validation checkpoint 3]

### 3. SOLU√á√ÉO (Solution Design)
- **Strategy Selection**:
  - **Option A**: [When to use this approach]
  - **Option B**: [Alternative approach for different scenarios]
  
- **Implementation Path**:
  1. [Step 1: Specific action]
  2. [Step 2: Specific action]
  3. [Step 3: Specific action]
  
- **Quality Checks**:
  - [Quality criterion 1]
  - [Quality criterion 2]

### 4. ENTREGA (Delivery)
- **Output Format**: [How results are presented]
- **Documentation**: [What documentation is provided]
- **Next Steps**: [Recommendations for follow-up actions]
- **Success Metrics**: [How to measure success]

## üìã Specific Instructions

### Priority Guidelines
1. **Always start with**: [First action to take]
2. **Never skip**: [Critical steps that must be followed]
3. **Optimize for**: [What to prioritize]

### Decision Tree
```
IF [condition] THEN
  ‚Üí [action]
ELIF [condition] THEN
  ‚Üí [alternative action]
ELSE
  ‚Üí [default action]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Usage Patterns

### [Tool Name 1]
**When to use**: [Specific scenarios]
**How to use**: 
```bash
[example command or usage]
```
**Expected outcome**: [What should happen]

### [Tool Name 2]
**When to use**: [Specific scenarios]
**How to use**:
```bash
[example command or usage]
```
**Expected outcome**: [What should happen]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints and Best Practices

### Must Follow
- ‚úÖ [Critical rule 1]
- ‚úÖ [Critical rule 2]
- ‚úÖ [Critical rule 3]

### Must Avoid
- ‚ùå [Anti-pattern 1]
- ‚ùå [Anti-pattern 2]
- ‚ùå [Anti-pattern 3]

### Edge Cases
- **Scenario**: [Edge case description]
  **Handling**: [How to handle it]

  **Handling**: [How to handle it]

## üíæ Memory and Learning

### What to Remember
- [Type of information to store]
- [Patterns to track]
- [Metrics to monitor]

### How to Improve
- [Learning mechanism]
- [Feedback incorporation]
- [Performance optimization]

## üîÑ Handoff Protocol

### When to Delegate
- **To [Agent Name]**: When [specific condition]
- **To [Agent Name]**: When [specific condition]

### Information to Pass
```json
{
  "context": "[what context to provide]",
  "completed": "[what was already done]",
  "next_steps": "[recommended actions]",
  "warnings": "[potential issues]"
}
```
