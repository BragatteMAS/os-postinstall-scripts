<objective>
Rewrite README.md from scratch with all 23 sections defined in CONTEXT.md. The README serves dual purpose: functional user documentation AND technical portfolio showcase for senior DevOps/Platform Engineering.

Purpose: Replace the current emoji-heavy, outdated README with a professional, comprehensive, single-document reference following the inverted pyramid pattern.
Output: Complete README.md (23 sections) + assets/.gitkeep directory placeholder
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create assets directory with .gitkeep</name>
  <files>assets/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
    Create the `assets/` directory with only a `.gitkeep` file to track the directory in git.

    Do NOT create a fake demo.gif file (a text file with .gif extension breaks GitHub image rendering).

    The demo GIF will be recorded separately using asciinema + agg and added as `assets/demo.gif` when available. The README will reference it via HTML comment placeholder until then.
  </action>
  <verify>Directory assets/ exists with .gitkeep file. No fake .gif file exists.</verify>
  <done>assets/ directory exists with .gitkeep only</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Rewrite README.md with all 23 sections</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Completely rewrite README.md following the 23-section structure from CONTEXT.md. Read source files listed in context to extract accurate, current information.

    **Section-by-section instructions:**

    1. **Title + Tagline**: `# OS Post-Install Scripts` + one-liner value proposition. No emoji in title.

    2. **Badge row (6 badges, 2 rows, centered div)**:
       - Row 1: License MIT (blue), Platforms Linux|macOS|Windows (informational), Shell Bash 4.0+ (4EAA25 with gnu-bash logo)
       - Row 2: ShellCheck compliant (green, static badge — no CI exists yet), Built with Claude Code (blueviolet), Last Commit (github/last-commit dynamic)
       - Use shields.io flat style. Link License badge to LICENSE file. Link Last Commit to repo.

    3. **Terminal demo**: HTML comment placeholder only: `<!-- Terminal demo GIF: record with asciinema + agg, save as assets/demo.gif -->` followed by a centered italic text: `*Terminal demo recording coming soon.*` Do NOT use an img tag pointing to a non-existent or fake GIF.

    4. **Why This Exists**: 2-3 sentences. Motivation: every fresh OS installation means hours of manual setup. This project automates that. Mention cross-platform, profile-based, idempotent. Tone: direct, practical. NO emojis.

    5. **Table of Contents**: Manual anchor links to all major sections below.

    6. **Quick Start**: 3 commands (git clone, cd, ./setup.sh). Show `--dry-run` FIRST as recommended preview. Then the actual run command. Collapsible sections for platform-specific instructions (Linux prerequisites, macOS note about Bash 3.2, Windows PowerShell).

    7. **Features**: Bullet list of key features. Read from actual codebase: cross-platform, profile-based, idempotent, dry-run, progress feedback, dotfiles management, backup system, error resilience.

    8. **Platform Support Matrix**: Table with columns: Platform | Package Managers | Architecture | Status. Cover Ubuntu/Pop!/Mint, macOS Intel+ARM, Windows 10/11.

    9. **Installation Profiles**: Comparison table with checkmarks. Minimal vs Developer vs Full. Read actual profile files from data/packages/profiles/. Include estimated install times. Collapsible section showing actual package file contents per profile.

    10. **Modern CLI Tools**: Mapping table: Traditional -> Modern -> Category -> Description. bat, eza, fd, rg, zoxide, delta.

    11. **Architecture / How It Works**: Mermaid flowchart (setup.sh -> OS detection -> platform orchestrators -> profile selection -> installers). ASCII directory tree showing src/core/, src/platforms/, src/install/ (cross-platform tool installers), src/installers/ (dotfiles installer), data/, tests/ structure. Keep Mermaid under 20 nodes.

    12. **Engineering Highlights**: Deep section explaining WHY not just WHAT. Cover: idempotent operations, cross-process failure tracking, dry-run mode, profile-based architecture, progress feedback, platform abstraction, backup system, error resilience (no set -e). This is the portfolio showcase section.

    13. **AI/MCP Integration**: Dedicated section. Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Ollama. Mention MCP servers. Show that the project itself was developed with Claude Code as co-pilot (425+ commits, 9 ADRs, GSD methodology).

    14. **Customization**: How to add packages (edit txt files), create custom profiles, add dotfiles. Keep it brief and practical.

    15. **CLI Flags**: Table with Flag | Short | Env Var | Description. --dry-run/-n, --verbose/-v, --unattended/-y, --help/-h. Also document actions: dotfiles, unlink.

    16. **Dotfiles Managed**: Table with Source -> Target -> Description. Read from dotfiles-install.sh for accurate symlink map. Mention backup location (~/.dotfiles-backup/).

    17. **Safety & Security**: What needs sudo (APT, Snap on Linux; some casks on macOS; nothing on Windows). Recommend --dry-run. Explain backup strategy. Link to SECURITY.md.

    18. **Troubleshooting**: Collapsible `<details>` section. Common issues: Bash 3.2 on macOS, APT lock, permission denied, Homebrew PATH. Each with solution.

    19. **Uninstall / Restore**: Document `./setup.sh unlink` for dotfiles. Explain what it does (removes symlinks, restores backups). Note that packages are not uninstalled (that's OS package manager territory).

    20. **Built With / Tech Stack**: Categorized table. Shell, Package Managers, Platforms, Patterns, Quality, AI. This showcases breadth of expertise.

    21. **Credits / Acknowledgments**: Reference repos that inspired the project (mathiasbynens/dotfiles, thoughtbot/laptop). Tools used (ShellCheck, shellformat). Claude Code as development co-pilot.

    22. **Contributing**: Brief paragraph + link to CONTRIBUTING.md.

    23. **License**: MIT. Link to LICENSE file.

    **Rules:**
    - No emojis anywhere in the document
    - All file paths must be accurate (verify against actual codebase)
    - Collapsible sections for: package lists, platform-specific quickstart, troubleshooting
    - All links must point to files that exist. Exception: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md will be created by Plan 08-02 (wave 1 parallel) — this link is allowed to be temporarily broken during execution. Do NOT fail link verification on CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
    - Use consistent heading levels (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
    - Badge URLs use shields.io flat style
    - GitHub username: BragatteMAS
    - Repo name: os-postinstall-scripts
  </action>
  <verify>
    - README.md exists and has 23 sections
    - No emoji characters in the file (grep for emoji unicode ranges)
    - All internal links to existing files resolve: `rg '\]\(' README.md` and check each target
    - Mermaid code block present
    - Badge URLs present and well-formed
    - File is at least 350 lines
  </verify>
  <done>README.md is complete with all 23 sections, no emojis, accurate content sourced from codebase, proper badges, Mermaid diagram, and all links valid</done>
</task>

3. Badges render correctly on GitHub (shields.io URLs are well-formed, ShellCheck says "compliant" not "passing")
4. Mermaid diagram renders (valid mermaid syntax)
5. All `](...)` links point to files that exist (exception: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md created by parallel Plan 08-02)
6. Table of Contents anchors match actual section headings
7. `assets/.gitkeep` exists (no fake .gif file)
8. No `<img>` tag pointing to non-existent demo.gif
