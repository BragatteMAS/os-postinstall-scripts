<objective>
Close two process debt items from the v2.1 milestone audit:
1. Create missing VERIFICATION.md for Phase 08 (Documentation)
2. Mark MOD-04 as "Complete" in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table

Purpose: All other phases have VERIFICATION.md files. Phase 08 was the only gap. MOD-04 was left "Pending" despite Phase 08 being complete since 2026-02-07.

Output: Two updated files closing the last process gaps in the v2.1 milestone.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/08-documentation/08-VERIFICATION.md</files>
  <action>
Verify Phase 08's 5 success criteria against the actual codebase and create VERIFICATION.md.

**Check each criterion:**

1. **README.md 23-section document:** Count sections in README.md (## headings). Verify it explains project purpose and getting started.
2. **README.md covers prerequisites, installation, usage, customization:** Grep for these sections in README.md.
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md with project-specific guidelines:** Verify file exists and is NOT boilerplate (should have project-specific content).
4. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists:** Verify file exists and contains Contributor Covenant v2.1.
5. **GitHub templates and repo metadata current:** Check .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ has templates. Check .github/ for metadata files.

**Write VERIFICATION.md** with this structure:

```markdown
# Phase 08: Documentation — Verification

**Phase:** 08-documentation
**Verified:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** passed

## Success Criteria

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | README.md 23-section document | ✓ | {N} sections found, covers project overview and getting started |
| 2 | README covers prereqs/install/usage/customize | ✓ | Sections found: {list} |
| 3 | CONTRIBUTING.md project-specific | ✓ | {line count} lines, project-specific content |
| 4 | CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md exists | ✓ | Contributor Covenant v2.1 |
| 5 | GitHub templates current | ✓ | {N} templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ |

## Must-Haves Verified

All 5/5 success criteria verified against codebase.

## Human Verification

None required — all criteria are statically verifiable.

## Gaps

None.
```

Set status to `passed` if all 5 criteria are met. If any fail, set `gaps_found` and document the gap.

  <verify>
- File exists at .planning/phases/08-documentation/08-VERIFICATION.md

  <name>Task 2: Mark MOD-04 complete in REQUIREMENTS.md</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Update two locations in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`:

1. **Checkbox (line ~56):** Change `- [ ] **MOD-04**:` to `- [x] **MOD-04**:`
2. **Traceability table (line ~122):** Change `| MOD-04 | Phase 8: Documentation | Pending |` to `| MOD-04 | Phase 8: Documentation | Complete |`

**Do NOT** modify any other lines in REQUIREMENTS.md.
  </action>
  <verify>
- MOD-04 checkbox is `[x]` (not `[ ]`)
- MOD-04 traceability row shows "Complete" (not "Pending")
- No other lines changed
  </verify>
  <done>MOD-04 marked complete in both checkbox and traceability table</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Phase 10.1 success criteria check:
1. Phase 08 has VERIFICATION.md with passing status — verified by Task 1
2. MOD-04 marked "Complete" in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table — verified by Task 2
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Phase 08 VERIFICATION.md exists with status: passed and 5/5 criteria
- MOD-04 is [x] in checkbox list and "Complete" in traceability table
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/10.1-process-debt-cleanup/10.1-01-SUMMARY.md`
