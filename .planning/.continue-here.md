<current_state>
Milestone v1.0 is at 57/57 plans (100%). All 22 phases complete.
Started /gsd:complete-milestone workflow but ran out of context at Step 0 (pre-flight check).
No milestone audit exists (.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md missing).

## This Session (BMAD Wizard Polish)
- Etapa A committed (008e61c): R0-R4 — timeout fix, welcome, profiles, summary, help callout
- Etapa B committed (274b6e3): R5-R8 — progress bar, state detection, read_with_timeout, retry
- Phase 03 closed (37b6bad): 03-04-SUMMARY.md created (dotfiles already delivered in 03-01 to 03-03)
- All 3 commits pushed to origin/main

## Files Modified (already committed)
- src/core/interactive.sh — read_with_timeout helper, safe timeout defaults
- src/core/progress.sh — show_progress bar, save/detect install state
- src/platforms/macos/main.sh — progress bar + retry_with_backoff
- src/platforms/linux/main.sh — progress bar + retry_with_backoff
- setup.sh — welcome banner, state detection, state save
- .planning/phases/03-dotfiles-management/03-04-SUMMARY.md — phase closure

## Milestone v1.0 Completion (run /gsd:complete-milestone)
The full workflow from complete-milestone.md:
1. Pre-flight: No audit exists — decide whether to run /gsd:audit-milestone or proceed
2. Verify readiness: Check REQUIREMENTS.md traceability
3. Gather stats: git range, LOC, timeline
4. Extract accomplishments: one-liners from all SUMMARY.md files
5. Archive milestone: milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md + v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md
6. Evolve PROJECT.md: full review
7. Reorganize ROADMAP.md: collapse to one-line
8. Retrospective, STATE.md update, git tag v1.0

## Future: BMAD Etapa C (backlog for next milestone)
- R9: Preview option in profile menu
- R10: CSV-driven package catalog
- R11: Complete CLI flags
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- BMAD Etapa A+B implemented as 2 separate commits (not one big change)
- Timeout default changed to "skip" (not "install-all") — critical UX bug fix
- Platform banners removed from show_menu() — centralized in setup.sh welcome
- retry_with_backoff now wraps all installer dispatch calls via record_failure pattern
- State file at ~/.config/os-postinstall/state (shell-sourceable format)
- Plan 03-04 closed as "already delivered" with summary documenting actual state
- BMAD Etapa C deferred to next milestone
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None. All code committed and pushed. Milestone completion is purely administrative.
</blockers>

<context>
The user wants to formally close milestone v1.0. The /gsd:complete-milestone workflow
is extensive (8 steps) and needs a fresh context window. The milestone audit is missing
but may be optional — ask user whether to run /gsd:audit-milestone first or proceed
directly with completion.
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:complete-milestone` in a fresh session. First decision: audit or proceed without.
Recommend: proceed without audit since all 57/57 plans have summaries and code is shipped.
</next_action>
